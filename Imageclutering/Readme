This is the folder having the image clustering gui code files written in pyqt
basic1 is the code for browsing multiple images and showing them on the same window .
basic2 is the code for the text box

basic 3 is  the copy of the basic 1 for safety purpose
now we have to combine basic 1 and basic2 i.e each image has its own textinpt box
